# HTTP API Guide

The `markdownfs-server` binary exposes a REST API for programmatic access to markdownfs. This guide covers every endpoint with request and response examples.

## Starting the Server

```bash
# Default: listen on 127.0.0.1:3000
cargo run --release --bin markdownfs-server

# Custom address
MARKDOWNFS_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8080 cargo run --release --bin markdownfs-server

# With custom data directory and logging
MARKDOWNFS_DATA_DIR=/var/data/markdownfs \
RUST_LOG=markdownfs=debug \
cargo run --release --bin markdownfs-server
```

## Authentication

Every request can include an auth header. Three modes are supported:

| Header | Description |
|---|---|
| `Authorization: User <username>` | Authenticate as a named user |
| `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Authenticate with an agent API token |
| *(no header)* | Defaults to `root` |

Examples:

```bash
# As a named user
curl -H "Authorization: User alice" http://localhost:3000/fs/

# As an agent (token from `addagent`)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer a1b2c3d4..." http://localhost:3000/fs/

# As root (no header needed)
curl http://localhost:3000/fs/
```

## Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "commits": 3,
  "inodes": 47,
  "objects": 12
}
```

## Login

Verify a user exists and get their identity:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "alice"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "username": "alice",
  "uid": 1,
  "gid": 2,
  "groups": ["alice", "wheel"]
}
```

## Filesystem Operations

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's a full session using `curl` to set up a project, write files, and manage versions:

curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/fs/project/docs \
  -H "Authorization: User alice" \
  -H "X-Markdownfs-Type: directory"

# 4. Write some files
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/fs/project/readme.md \
  -H "Authorization: User alice" \
  -d "# My Project

Version 1.0 — initial release."
